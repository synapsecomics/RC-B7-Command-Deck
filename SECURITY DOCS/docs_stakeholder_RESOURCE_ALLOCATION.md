      staff: 30%
      priority: "Critical"
      rotation: "24/7"
      
    development:
      staff: 40%
      priority: "High"
      rotation: "Regular"
      
    support:
      staff: 30%
      priority: "High"
      rotation: "24/7"

  support_teams:
    community:
      staff: 40%
      priority: "High"
      rotation: "Extended"
      
    wellness:
      staff: 30%
      priority: "Critical"
      rotation: "24/7"
      
    operations:
      staff: 30%
      priority: "High"
      rotation: "Regular"
```

    allocation: "Reserved"
    scaling: "Dynamic"
    monitoring: "Active"

  support_systems:
    resources: "Medium"
    allocation: "Flexible"
    scaling: "Manual"
    monitoring: "Regular"
```

### 2. Support Systems
```yaml

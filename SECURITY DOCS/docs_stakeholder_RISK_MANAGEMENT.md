## Risk Assessment Matrix

### 1. Impact Levels
| Level    | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Critical | System-wide failure | Complete service outage |
| High     | Major disruption   | Partial system failure |
| Medium   | Limited impact     | Feature unavailability |
| Low      | Minor issues       | Cosmetic problems |

### 2. Likelihood Scale
| Level    | Probability | Timeframe |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| High     | >70%        | 3 months  |
| Medium   | 30-70%      | 6 months  |
| Low      | 10-30%      | 12 months |
| Minimal  | <10%        | 24 months |

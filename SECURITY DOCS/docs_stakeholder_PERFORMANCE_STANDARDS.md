  response_time:
    critical: "<100ms"
    acceptable: "<200ms"
    warning: "<500ms"
    critical_threshold: ">500ms"
    monitoring: "Real-time"

  availability:
    target: "99.99%"
    minimum: "99.9%"
    critical: "<99.9%"
    calculation: "Monthly"
    monitoring: "Continuous"

  error_rates:
    acceptable: "<0.1%"
    warning: "0.1-0.5%"
    critical: ">0.5%"
    monitoring: "Real-time"
```

### 2. User Experience
```yaml

  interaction:
    load_time: "<2s"
    response_time: "<200ms"
    error_rate: "<0.1%"
    satisfaction: ">4.5/5"

  engagement:
    session_length: "Baseline +20%"
    return_rate: ">80%"
    feature_usage: ">70%"
    completion_rate: ">90%"

  support:
    response_time: "<4h"

    response: "Immediate"

  warning:
    response_time: ">200ms"
    error_rate: ">0.1%"
    cpu_usage: ">70%"
    memory_usage: ">70%"
    response: "<15 minutes"

  notice:
    response_time: ">150ms"
    error_rate: ">0.05%"
    cpu_usage: ">60%"
    memory_usage: ">60%"
    response: "<1 hour"
```

### 2. User Experience Alerts
```yaml
ux_alerts:
  critical:

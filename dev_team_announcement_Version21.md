# Dev Team Announcement — RC-B7 Command Deck Update

**Crew Manifest Integration & Interactive UI Released!**

### What’s New?
- Entire crew manifest now populates the command deck UI — leadership, agents, and rogue elements.
- Live EKG status pulses for every crew member, updating in real-time.
- Filter by group and click crew for modal detail view (role, assignment, quote, lore).
- Crew status can be wired to story events/logs (demo event included).
- Oracle mode (rain/glitch) and Birthday Cake mode (confetti/sprinkles) polish.

### Why It Matters
- Sets the foundation for narrative-driven UI, live mission status, and ARG mechanics.
- Enables devs and writers to trigger crew state via logs, events, or backend data.
- Future: support for clickable logs, crew bios, deep lore, and real mission integration.

### How to Test
1. Open the Command Deck UI.
2. Filter crew by group and interact with cards/modals.
3. Watch crew status update live and via story events.
4. Toggle Oracle/Birthday modes.
5. Review README for full feature list.

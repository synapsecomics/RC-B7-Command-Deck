# Trustless Narrative Ledger (TNL) Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Design & Prototyping (Month 1-2)
- **Goals:** Move from centralized ledger to TNL architecture. Establish foundation for validator/observer nodes and smart contracts.
- **Tasks:**
  - Review Trustless Narrative Ledger Whitepaper and security memorandum.
  - Define technical requirements for validator and observer nodes.
  - Draft initial smart contract logic for narrative voting (e.g., vote weighting).
  - Collaborate with Grok & Claude on blockchain architecture sketches.
  - Prototype ledger with mock transactions and sample data.
  - Identify all legacy components relying on Canon Divergence Ledger.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Technical specification for TNL.
  - Prototype blockchain & smart contract code.
  - Task breakdown and assignments for stakeholders.

## Phase 2: Development & Testing (Month 3-4)
- **Goals:** Build, deploy, and audit TNL components. Prepare for migration and community engagement.
- **Tasks:**
  - Deploy permissioned blockchain on selected infrastructure.
  - Develop migration scripts for legacy data.
  - Implement PBFT consensus and security features.
  - Integrate fan submission workflows (ARG, Google Forms, X posts).
  - Conduct internal and community beta test with observer node access.
  - Begin regular smart contract audits with Copilot.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Functional TNL network (testnet).
  - Audited smart contracts.
  - Beta test report and feedback summary.

## Phase 3: Deployment & Integration (Month 5-6)
- **Goals:** Go live with TNL as the “single source of truth” for narrative decisions. Complete system migration.
- **Tasks:**
  - Migrate Canon Divergence Ledger data to TNL.
  - Launch TNL for live narrative updates (comics, TTRPG, ARG).
  - Integrate ledger with Continuity-Influence Module and analytics tools.
  - Monitor system performance and user engagement.
  - Set up feedback/reporting mechanisms for all stakeholders.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Live TNL network.
  - Updated Continuity-Influence Module.
  - Public ledger access for fans.
  - Migration report.

## Phase 4: Optimization & Scaling (Month 7-12)
- **Goals:** Ensure system can scale, improve decentralization, and respond to narrative outcomes.
- **Tasks:**
  - Optimize node performance for high-volume fan input.
  - Expand validator pool to include trusted fan leaders.
  - Iterate smart contracts and ledger rules based on narrative outcomes.
  - Update documentation and provide ongoing training.
  - Conduct post-mortem reviews and incorporate lessons learned.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Scalable, robust TNL network.
  - Expanded validator/observer node network.
  - Updated docs, training materials, and process improvements.

## General Recommendations
- **Regular meetings:** Biweekly check-ins for stakeholders.
- **Documentation:** Update project docs after each phase.
- **Security:** Continuous audits and incident reporting.
- **Feedback:** Open channels for consultant and community input.
